An ERC20 token allowing users to interact with a frontend gaming portal.

Begin with the most basic implementation of an ERC20 and build from there.
I want to set an initial supply and to mint that supply upon deployment. So within the constructor the \_mint() function is called and an amount is entered.

## Add a mint function to my contract that only the owner can call. The owner can mint to any address.

## Add a css file to my frontend

## Add a mintMinerReward function that gives a miner 50 tokens each time a block is mined.

- attempt to decrease the amount after a certain amount of time
- attempt to create an air drop of tokens along with miner reward with each block mined. Airdrop to any contract that has interacted with the blockchain
