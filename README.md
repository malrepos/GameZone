# GameZone

An ERC20 token allowing users to interact with a frontend gaming portal.

Begin with the most basic implementation of an ERC20 and build from there.
I want to set an initial supply and to mint that supply upon deployment. So within the constructor the \_mint() function is called and an amount is entered.

## Add the onlyOwner contract to my contract

## Add a mint function to my contract that only the owner can call. The owner can mint to any address.
