            <h1>An Online Games Arcade</h1>
            <article><p>When I was younger I spent a lot of time in game arcades. The main one in Australia was called "TimeZone". Incidentally, it is beginning to make a comback in large shopping centers as family friendly amusement "parks". The majority of gaming is now online, however.</p> 
                <figure>
                    <div class="timezone">
                    <img src="../Images/Timezone">
                    <figcaption>TimeZone gaming arcade</figcaption>
                    </div>
                </figure>
                 
            <p>The purpose of this project is to recreate a games arcade for the digital space. In order to make it more attractive than the currently accessible gaming venues, GameZone will create a community, and within it competition and cooperation.</p> </article>
